\# Build Tool Showcase

\## Project Description

The Build Tool Showcase is a small web application designed to
demonstrate various build tools and package managers. This project
highlights the use of Webpack, Babel, Sass, and other modern web
development practices. It features a header, a content area displaying
popular build tools from a JSON file, and a footer with a copyright
notice.

\## Setup Instructions

1\. \*\*Clone the Repository:\*\* \`\`\`bash git clone
https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git cd your-repository

Install Dependencies:

bash

npm install

Project Structure: src/ - Contains the main JavaScript entry point
(index.js), SCSS files, and other source code. public/ - Contains static
assets such as images and JSON files. webpack.common.js - Shared Webpack
configuration. webpack.dev.js - Webpack configuration for development.
webpack.prod.js - Webpack configuration for production.

Available npm Scripts

npm run start: Start the development server with hot reloading on port
3000. npm run build: Create a production build with minified assets and
code splitting. npm run lint: Run ESLint to check code quality. npm
test: Run unit tests using Jest.

Build Process

Development: Webpack Dev Server serves the application with live
reloading. Static assets are served from the public/ directory. Source
maps are enabled for easier debugging.

Production: Webpack bundles and minifies JavaScript and CSS. Code
splitting is implemented for external libraries to optimize loading
times. The build output is placed in the dist/ directory.

For more details on the technologies used, refer to the documentation
for Webpack, Babel, and ESLint.
